# pyagree
A simple Python module to compute some inter-rater agreement measures. Among the other measures this package provides an implementation for both the _Information Agreement_ and the _extension-by-continuity of Information Agreement_ coefficients (see [[1]](#information_agreement)).



## Documentation

[Here](https://pyagree.readthedocs.io/) you can find the *pyagree* documentation. It contains:

- the instruction to install the package
- the user manual and some examples
- the API manual



## Examples

In order to use `pyagree`, it is sufficient to import it, for instance, 
by using the statement

```python
import pyagree
```

After that, all the functions reported can be invoked as follows:

```python
pyagree.<function name>(<parameter1>, ...)
```

Alternatively, the desired functions can be individually imported 
and avoiding the package name prefix as in:

```python
from pyagree import <function name>

<function name>(<parameter1>, ...)
```

For instance, the Python program:

```python
from pyagree import YuleY, CohenKappa
	
A = [[10,  1],
	 [ 5, 10]]
	
Y = YuleY(A)
K = CohenKappa(A)
	
print('Yule = {}'.format(Y))
print('Kappa = {}'.format(K))
```

evaluates both Yule's Y and Cohen's kappa of  the agreement matrix A and print them in output.
