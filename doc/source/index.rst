Installing `pyagree`
====================

.. toctree::

There are two main ways to install `pyagree`. The first one requires to clone 
`pyagree's repository from GitHub <https://github.com/albertocasagrande/pyagree>`_ by using the following command::

    git clone https://github.com/albertocasagrande/pyagree.git

Once the command has fully been executed, the repository directory must be entered 
and the package can be installed by issuing as 
`superuser (administrator or root) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser>`_
the following commands::

    cd pyagree
    python setup.py install

The second method to install `pyagree` is easier, but requires the tool `pip` 
(see `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_) and it may install a 
non-bleeding edge version of the package. As superuser, issue the 
command::

    pip install pyagree
